# BitGrin - Build, Configuration, and Running

## Supported Platforms

Longer term, most platforms will likely be supported to some extent.
BitGrin's programming language `rust` has buildÂ targets for most platforms.

What's working so far?

* Linux x86\_64 and MacOS [bitgrin + mining + development]
* Windows 10 coming soon with GUI

## Requirements

* rust 1.31+ (use [rustup]((https://www.rustup.rs/))- i.e. `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh; source $HOME/.cargo/env`)
  * if rust is already installed, you can simply update version with `rustup update`
* clang
* ncurses and libs (ncurses, ncursesw5)
* zlib libs (zlib1g-dev or zlib-devel)
* pkg-config
* libssl-dev
* linux-headers (reported needed on Alpine linux)
* llvm

For Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc), all in one line (except Rust):

```sh
apt install build-essential cmake git libgit2-dev clang libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev zlib1g-dev pkg-config libssl-dev llvm
```

## Build steps

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitgrin/bitgrin.git
cd bitgrin
cargo build --release
```

BitGrin can also be built in debug mode (without the `--release` flag, but using the `--debug` or the `--verbose` flag) but this will render fast sync prohibitively slow due to the large overhead of cryptographic operations.

## What was built?

A successful build gets you:

* `target/release/bitgrin` - the main bitgrin binary

All data, configuration and log files created and used by bitgrin are located in the hidden
`~/.bitgrin` directory (under your user home directory) by default. You can modify all configuration
values by editing the file `~/.bitgrin/bitgrin-server.toml`.

It is also possible to have bitgrin create its data files in the current directory. To do this, run

```sh
bitgrin server config
```

Which will generate a `bitgrin-server.toml` file in the current directory, pre-configured to use
the current directory for all of its data. Running bitgrin from a directory that contains a
`bitgrin-server.toml` file will use the values in that file instead of the default
`~/.bitgrin/bitgrin-server.toml`.

While testing, put the bitgrin binary on your path like this:

```sh
export PATH=/path/to/bitgrin/dir/target/release:$PATH
```

Where path/to/bitgrin/dir is your absolute path to the root directory of your BitGrin installation.

You can then run `bitgrin` directly (try `bitgrin help` for more options).

## Configuration

BitGrin attempts to run with sensible defaults, and can be further configured via
the `bitgrin-server.toml` file. This file is generated by bitgrin on its first run, and
contains documentation on each available option.

While it's recommended that you perform all bitgrin server configuration via
`bitgrin-server.toml`, it's also possible to supply command line switches to bitgrin that
override any settings in the file.

For help on bitgrin commands and their switches, try:

```sh
bitgrin help
bitgrin wallet help
bitgrin client help
```

## Docker

```sh
docker build -t bitgrin -f etc/Dockerfile .
```
For floonet, use `etc/Dockerfile.floonet` instead

You can bind-mount your bitgrin cache to run inside the container.

```sh
docker run -it -d -v $HOME/.bitgrin:/root/.bitgrin bitgrin
```
If you prefer to use a docker named volume, you can pass `-v dotbitgrin:/root/.bitgrin` instead.
Using a named volume copies default configurations upon volume creation

## Cross-platform builds

Rust (cargo) can build bitgrin for many platforms, so in theory running `bitgrin`
as a validating node on your low powered device might be possible.
To cross-compile `bitgrin` on a x86 Linux platform and produce ARM binaries,
say, for a Raspberry Pi.

## Using bitgrin

The wiki page [How to use bitgrin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/How-to-use-bitgrin)
and linked pages have more information on what features we have,
troubleshooting, etc.

## Mining in BitGrin

Please note that all mining functions for BitGrin have moved into a separate, standalone package called
[bitgrin-miner](https://github.com/bitgrin/bitgrin-miner). Once your BitGrin code node is up and running,
you can start mining by building and running bitgrin-miner against your running BitGrin node.

For bitgrin-miner to be able to communicate with your bitgrin node, make sure that you have `enable_stratum_server = true`
in your `bitgrin-server.toml` configuration file and you have a wallet listener running (`bitgrin wallet listen`).
